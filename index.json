However, producing swirl while not presenting a severe pressure drop can be a challenge. In this paper, a desired shape of guidance blades for laminar swirl flow is determined by numerical simulation in OpenFOAM. Emphasis is on the mesh technique, where a predefined blade shape is formed by mesh twisting, or morphing. The validity of numerical simulations on a twisted mesh is shown by comparing it to the theoretical solution of laminar flow in a pipe without swirl and guidance blades. A sensitivity study shows that a cell size ratio of 0.025 of diameter is sufficient and affects the solution minimally. To determine the desired shape of guidance blades previously found optimal swirl decay and velocity profile for laminar swirling flow are utilized. Three blade shapes are explored: (I) with a twist angle that varies with axial location only; (II) having a deviation angle matching the theoretical deviation angle for laminar swirling flow; (III) same as II but with a hollow center. Simulations are performed for Re=100 and swirl number S=0.2. Case II is able to sustain swirl longest while maintaining a low pressure drop and is therefore a desired swirler shape profile as predicted theoretically.","tags":["fbob"],"title":"Mesh Twisting Technique for Swirl Induced Laminar Flow Used to Determine a Desired Blade Shape","type":"publication"},{"authors":["bruce indurain","francois beaubert","david uystepryst","sylvain lalot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"37fdfedd15791ed4ca941dc5a56c8f65","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/indurain-cfd-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.247438Z","relpermalink":"/publication/indurain-cfd-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["fbob"],"title":"CFD study of the convective heat transfer in a swirling flow for several flow regimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["jean-baptiste offroy","nachida bourabaa","françois beaubert","eric delacourt","céline morin","eric therssen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"f124b0e47451b810c9dbf59c77b61448","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/offroy-combustion-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.248381Z","relpermalink":"/publication/offroy-combustion-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["fbob"],"title":"Combustion characterization in a biomass boiler with PAHs oxidation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["fahd boukrouche","christophe moreau","julien pelle","françois beaubert","souad harmand","olivier moreau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"daabc504c0ae1821fb83da8a1984cabc","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/boukrouche-mock-up-2017/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.24261Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boukrouche-mock-up-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Power transmission through power cables installed in ventilated tunnels is increasingly used worldwide and offers a complex thermal environment.

Using a simplified scale model equipped with a heated pole, it was possible to measure the temperature distribution on the pole surface and to deduce, through numerical simulations, the heat transfer coefficients. The results show an asymmetric profile in the tangential direction since lower h values are found closer to the trailing edge due to the presence of a flow recirculation zone. Furthermore, the heat transfer profiles indicate that, although fans improve cooling at the top and bottom ends of the pole, the highest h values are found in an intermediate region. This is due to the flow from the fans that enters the interpole space and only after penetrating a certain distance in the axial direction it exits through the air gap and goes around the pole face. The study also shows that the heat transfer coefficients along the pole face at 300 rpm average about four times those at 50 rpm.","tags":["cfd","heat transfer coefficient","hydrogenerator","fem","salient pole machine","fbob"],"title":"Heat transfer coefficient distribution on the pole face of a hydrogenerator scale model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["n. lancial","f. torriano","f. beaubert","s. harmand","g. rolland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409529600,"objectID":"9aacb57f7aaf35b781f559ae5ade6ca0","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/lancial-study-2014/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.243349Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lancial-study-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates a Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flow in an annular channel of a slotted rotating inner cylinder, corresponding to a salient pole hydrogenerator.

Various methods have been proposed to increase the shear stress of the fluid near the pipe wall. This is known to reduce fouling rate, as well as increasing the heat transfer rate of heat exchangers. In this article, the effect of fouling-rate reduction is investigated by increasing friction in a circular pipe. This is done by inducing swirling flow at the pipe entrance, which in turn increases velocities close to the wall and consequently the shear stress. Results are obtained from a three-dimensional finite-volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, where the pipe is modeled along with a swirling device at the entrance. Flow conditions are set to the laminar regime, where the effects of swirling flow are much more influential than in turbulent flow. It is concluded that considerable increase in friction can be obtained, but at the cost of increase in pressure drop.","tags":["fbob"],"title":"Inducing Swirling Flow in Heat Exchanger Pipes for Reduced Fouling Rate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["nicolas lancial","gilles rolland","françois beaubert","souad harmand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"f6a8be259a8cf647fa454ccfb5c43791","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/lancial-effets-2013/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.246203Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lancial-effets-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cfd","coefficient de frottement pariétal","jet relâché","marche non-confinée","mesures infrarouge","mesures par fils chauds","méthode inverse","nombre de nusselt local","fbob"],"title":"Effets d’un jet relaché sur les transferts thermiques en aval d’une marche descendante non-confinée","type":"publication"},{"authors":["halldór pálsson","françois beaubert","sylvain lalot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"14e51d67f44b994dd57be7704cfe0938","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/palsson-increased-2011/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.248995Z","relpermalink":"/publication/palsson-increased-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["fbob"],"title":"Increased shear stress in annular swirling flow for reduced fouling rate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["françois beaubert","tiphanie fourmeau","souad harmand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"96294ff2647d8736ef3a31bff447af2b","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/beaubert-etude-2010/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.251428Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beaubert-etude-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["fbob"],"title":"Etude numérique de la structure de l'écoulement dans un alternateur discoïde d'une éolienne","type":"publication"},{"authors":["l. labraga","g. kahissim","l. keirsbulck","f. beaubert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1172707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1172707200,"objectID":"eadfa581d7d17e911d236975fb43f485","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/labraga-experimental-2007/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.244803Z","relpermalink":"/publication/labraga-experimental-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"The flow past a rotating cylinder placed within a uniform stream is investigated at Reynolds numbers ranging from 8500 to 17,000 to 34,000. The dimensionless rotation rate α (ratio of the cylinder peripheral speed to the free-stream velocity) varies from 0 to 7. The experimental investigation is based on laser-Doppler anemometry measurements and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) within a water channel. The analysis of the experimental results mainly concerns the location of the separation points as defined by various criteria. It is found that the criterion suggested by Moore, Rott and Sears (MRS) is met in the case of the downstream-moving walls. Moreover, this study shows that sufficient information was obtained to confirm that the MRS criterion is still valid even in the case of the upstream-moving walls. This is confirmed by the behavior of the vertical velocity component educed from the averaged two-dimensional flow field obtained by PIV measurements.","tags":["fbob"],"title":"An Experimental Investigation of the Separation Points on a Circular Rotating Cylinder in Cross Flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["m. haddad","l. labraga","l. keirsbulck","f. beaubert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"7e01ce792c1dd290c39446d59f87d800","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/haddad-effet-2005/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.250224Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haddad-effet-2005/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["fbob"],"title":"Effet du soufflage a travers une paroi poreuse dans un canal bidimensionnel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["l. keirsbulck","g. kahissim","l. labraga","f. beaubert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072915200,"objectID":"fc8d128312aa9990dcea91fa3a4d8dec","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/keirsbulck-experimental-2004/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.249241Z","relpermalink":"/publication/keirsbulck-experimental-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["fbob"],"title":"An Experimental Investigation of the Separation Points on a Circular Rotating Cylinder in Cross Flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["françois beaubert","stéphane viazzo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1059696000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1059696000,"objectID":"0f624d9b1e016b375732dd4a1d8f819c","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/beaubert-large-2003/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.245166Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beaubert-large-2003/","section":"publication","summary":"The flow field of plane impinging jets at moderate Reynolds numbers has been computed using large eddy simulation technique. Two Reynolds numbers (Re=3000 and 7500) defined by the jet exit conditions are considered. Computations have been carried out using the dynamic Smagorinsky model. The simulations were performed to study the mean velocity, the turbulence statistics along the jet axis and at different vertical locations. The dynamics of the jet is explored using the instantaneous velocity, vorticity and low pressure fields with a focus on the impinging zone. The present results compare favorably to the experimental data available in the literature. The effect of the jet Reynolds number is significant between 3000 and 7500 both on the near and far field structure.","tags":["impinging jet","large eddy simulation","subgrid model","turbulence","fbob"],"title":"Large eddy simulations of plane turbulent impinging jets at moderate Reynolds numbers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["françois beaubert","stéphane viazzo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041379200,"objectID":"6bc93b755fc35713a4e3b02ba350aa55","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/beaubert-large-2003-1/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.249509Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beaubert-large-2003-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["fbob"],"title":"Large Eddy Simulation of flow and mass transfer in a plane turbulent impinging jet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["françois beaubert","stéphane viazzo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1038700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1038700800,"objectID":"1603902818971c72d8bf10df5aa62441","permalink":"https://fbob.github.io/publication/beaubert-large-2002/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T08:51:43.245525Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beaubert-large-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"Large Eddy Simulations of a plane turbulent impinging jet have been carried out using the dynamic Smagorinsky model.
