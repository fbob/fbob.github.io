 abstract = {The flow field of plane impinging jets at moderate Reynolds numbers has been computed using large eddy simulation technique. Two Reynolds numbers (Re=3000 and 7500) defined by the jet exit conditions are considered. Computations have been carried out using the dynamic Smagorinsky model. The simulations were performed to study the mean velocity, the turbulence statistics along the jet axis and at different vertical locations. The dynamics of the jet is explored using the instantaneous velocity, vorticity and low pressure fields with a focus on the impinging zone. The present results compare favorably to the experimental data available in the literature. The effect of the jet Reynolds number is significant between 3000 and 7500 both on the near and far field structure.},
