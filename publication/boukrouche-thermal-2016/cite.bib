 abstract = {Power transmission through power cables installed in ventilated tunnels has been increasingly used worldwide and offers a complex thermal environment. Established correlations currently in use have been deduced from a non-fully developed turbulent flow. This paper details the experimental investigation of the heat transfer from a single cable in a fully developed turbulent air flow, with emphasis on the effect of the cable spacing from the tunnel wall. Nusselt numbers have been compared for different spacing and velocities. The overall heat transfer is found to be meaningfully lower than in previous studies and no threshold spacing value for the average heat transfer to decrease is clearly found. Thermal radiation is found to greatly impact the cable cooling profile.},
