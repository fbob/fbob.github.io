 abstract = {Large Eddy Simulations of a plane turbulent impinging jet have been carried out using the dynamic Smagorinsky model. The statistical results are first validated with the measurements from the literature: mean and turbulent quantities along the jet axis and at different vertical locations are presented. This study is completed by the analysis of the wall shear stress at the impingement wall. The effect of the jet Reynolds number (3000⩽Re⩽13500) on the kinematic development of the jet is also discussed.},
